Examples contain:
* a boolean value
* numeric values
* a text/string value
* a list with each type of value
* a list with 2 lists in it
* a list with 2 maps in it
* a map with each type of value
* a map with 2 lists in it
* a map with 2 maps in it

XML is a special case, because there is more than one way to represent the same data which is tested separately.
